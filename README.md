# Project Description

So in my Final Year Project on 2022/23, I've build an ecommerce website called PC Builder. It was my first project.
Yes, I have fun working on that project but I lied if that project actually complete right.
So you can take a look to my UNFINISH project. Thanks.

# What the main purpose of the project

I want to make an ecommerce website and choose PC component as the products in the website.
It focus on PC component and purposely to help any PC builder buy their remaining PC component.

# What am I gonna do next

I am gonna fix everything (if i could) as I can, So that I can relax looking at my 'finish' project.
That will be on my next respisotary.

# Completed version file (GDrive)

Please take a noted that the file may not actually perfect, Because they were several errors that I let off, (SERIOUSLY THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH TIME TO FIX THAT)
So I leave a link to that PHP file here>>  <<

# Disclaimer

When I working on this project, I use another source code file (IDK where was the file ive been copy on)
So there will be nearly 60% of the code will change, I think more than that but we will see.
